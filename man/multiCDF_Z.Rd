}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The variable to for which to plot CDFs}

\item{seq_length}{The number of points over which to fit x}

\item{distributions}{The distributions to fit x against}

\item{palette}{The color palette to use on the graph}

\item{var_name}{The variable name to use for x}

\description{
This function is a version of multiCDF_plot from my MultiFitR package that is customized to use
formatting that I like. However, this formatting uses several packages that I didn't want to include in the
base MultiFitR or MultiFitRgg packages. (showtext and scico)
