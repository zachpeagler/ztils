- [x] implement proper testing with testthat
  - [ ] add more tests (get to 100% code coverage)
- [ ] add vignettes
- [ ] improve function error codes to be more descriptive
- [x] remake 'predict_plot' to lower cyclomatic complexity
    - this should be relatively easy by changing the group vs non-grouped behavior
